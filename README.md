# Welcome to Deep Learning in Neuroscience course for FENS 2022 Summer School 2022!
Here you will find a collection of code and links for the Deep Learning in Neuroscience taught by [Edgar Y. Walker](https://eywalkerlab.com), as part of the FENS 2022 Summer School.


## Most importantly, you can launch the Jupyter notebook for the workshop in Colab by clicking on the badge below!

## How to run on your own setup without Colab
If you prefer to run this on your own machine and without using Colab, you can do so by using this repository content.
Start by downloading/cloning this repository. 

### Using Docker
The repository is configured to work simply with `docker-compose`, so assuming you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and `docker-compose` configured on your machine, all you'll have to do will be to navigate to the directory and run the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

You can then navigate to http://localhost:8888 in your browser to access the Jupyter Lab server, properly configured.

### Running natively
If you prefer to not use Docker, then launch a Jupyter server and navigate to the Jupyter notebook `Deep-Learning-in-Neuroscience.ipynb` found in `notebooks` directory. You may have to adjust a few paths for your data download.
