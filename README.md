# Welcome to the hands-on workshop on machine learning at 2022 FENS Summer School!
Here you will find a collection of code and links for the hands-on workshop on machine learning in neuroscience taught by [Edgar Y. Walker](https://eywalkerlab.com), as part of the  [FENS Summer School on 'Artificial and natural computations for sensory perception: what is the link?'](https://www.fens.org/news-activities/fens-and-societies-calendar/training-event/fens-summer-school-on-artificial-and-natural-computations-for-sensory-perception-what-is-the-link).


## Most importantly, you can launch the Jupyter notebook for the workshop in Colab by clicking on the badge below!
For the notebook with exercises:

For the version with all exercises completed:

## How to run on your own setup without Colab
If you prefer to run this on your own machine and without using Colab, you can do so by using this repository content.
Start by downloading/cloning this repository. 

### Using Docker
The repository is configured to work simply with `docker-compose`, so assuming you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and `docker-compose` configured on your machine, all you'll have to do will be to navigate to the directory and run the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

You can then navigate to http://localhost:8888 in your browser to access the Jupyter Lab server, properly configured.

### Running natively
If you prefer to not use Docker, then launch a Jupyter server and navigate to the Jupyter notebook `Deep-Learning-in-Neuroscience.ipynb` found in `notebooks` directory. You may have to adjust a few paths for your data download.
